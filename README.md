# AdventOfCode22
This repo contains all my solutions for the various problems in Advent of Code 2022 that I have been able to solve till now. Feel free to review the codes and suggest changes if you want to. 
PS: Some of the codes might involve hard-coding the inputs. This is because I might have found it a real pain to parse the file inputs fully and store them as intended by the questions (For example, Day 5).
